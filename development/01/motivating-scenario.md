# Motivating Scenario (Iteration 1)

## Name
Basic document entites

## Description
Documents are one of the main entities within Triple's infrastructure. Each document has a substantial number of fields, which in turn are divided into a fair number of subfields. Some can be considered basic fields, with which simple queries can be constructed. 
These fields can be grouped as follows:

* Content fields:
    * `Abstract`
    * `Title`
    * `Language`
    * `Topic`
    * `Document Type`
* Fields about the subjects involved in the creation and publishing of the document:
    * `Author`
    * `Contributor`
    * `Publisher`
* Time fields:
    * `Publication date`
* Technical fields, for the identification of the document within Triple's infrastructure or within other infrastructures that precede insertion into Triple's architecture:
    * `Id`
    * `DOI`
    * `Identifer`
